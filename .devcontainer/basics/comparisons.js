// comparison will be done b/w two same datatypes , predictable results wiil not come 
// console.log(2>=3) -> ans will come in true/false , >,<,<=,>=,!=  -> sab exist karta hai, same with string 
// == has its own rules and doesnâ€™t treat null as a numeric value and it treats null as NaN.Relational operators like >, <, >=, and <= coerce null into a numeric value (0) for the comparison., so answer of null>0 -> flase , null>=0 -> true , null==0 -> false 
// == , aur baaki sab ka thoda alag tarika hai working ka 
// undefined ka comparison with 0 ke case mai sabhi mai false aayega 
// === -> strict check , this also checks value + datatype , "2"==2 -> can give true kyonki conversion hone lagta hai but "2"===2 -> will give false because datatypes are not same
